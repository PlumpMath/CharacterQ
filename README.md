# CharacterQ

A hole to fill in this summer: 

An Three.js app for generating character with components of models

~~Might use glTF format to take advantage of the node hierachy => proxy (weapon, glasses), animation/skeleton~~
(fbx => glTF converter still seems to be not very mature) 

## A very sketchy design:

## Subdivide goal:

- [ ] Entertainment App
  - [ ] Basic Three.js Renderer (Display booth)
    - [ ] a skeleton character
    - [ ] Assemble of different body parts
  - [ ] More advanced feature
    - [ ] skeleton animation
    - [ ] bone scaling
    - [ ] control point and vertex displacement
  - [ ] An app
    - [ ] share to facebook, etc..
    - [ ] single page app (js framework?)
    - [ ] deployment
- [ ] glTF game model exporter (combine different parts and output to one)
- [ ] Unity plugin? (low poly character generator)
